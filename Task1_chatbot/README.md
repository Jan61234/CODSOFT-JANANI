## Aim
To build a simple chatbot that responds to user queries using rule-based if-else statements.

## How it works
- Takes user input from the console.
- Checks for keywords like "hello", "bye", or "how are you".
- Responds with predefined answers.

## How to run
1. Open the `chatbot.py` file.
2. Run it using Python: `python chatbot.py`
3. Type your messages and the chatbot will respond.

## Sample Output
You: Hello  
Chatbot: Hi there! How can I help you today?  

You: How are you?  
Chatbot: I'm just a bot, but I'm doing great! Thanks for asking.  

You: Bye  
Chatbot: Goodbye! Have a great day.
