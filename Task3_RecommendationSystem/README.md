# Recommendation System

## Aim
To create a simple recommendation system that suggests items to users based on their preferences using a content-based approach.

## How it works
- Users have a list of items they like (movies, books, or products).  
- The system looks at other users’ preferences and suggests items the current user hasn’t interacted with yet.  
- This is a simple content-based filtering method using Python lists and dictionaries.

## How to run
1. Open the `recommendation.py` file.  
2. Run it using Python: `python recommendation.py`  
3. Follow the prompts or see the hardcoded example recommendations.

## Sample Output
Recommendations for Alice: {'Titanic', 'Joker'}  
Recommendations for Bob: {'Harry Potter', 'Joker'}  
Recommendations for Charlie: {'Inception', 'Avengers'}
