# Recommendation System

## Aim
To create a simple recommendation system that suggests items to users based on their preferences using a content-based approach.

## How it works
- Users have a list of items they like in this case, Movies
- The system looks at other users’ preferences and suggests items the current user hasn’t interacted with yet.  
- This is a simple content-based filtering method using Python lists and dictionaries.

## How to run
1. Open the `recommendation.py` file.  
2. Run it using Python: `python recommendation.py`  
3. Follow the prompts or see the hardcoded example recommendations.

## Sample Output
Welcome to the Smart Movie Recommendation System!

Enter your favorite movies one by one (type 'done' when finished):
Movie: Inception
Movie: Avengers
Movie: done

 Based on your preferences, you might enjoy:
 - Interstellar
 - Tenet
 - The Prestige
 - Iron Man
 - Captain America
 - Thor

 Thank you for using the Recommendation System!
