# Tic-Tac-Toe AI

## Aim
To implement an AI agent that plays the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player using the Minimax algorithm.

## How it works
- The human plays as "X" and the AI plays as "O".
- The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to choose the best move, making it unbeatable.
- The game checks for a winner or draw after every move.

## How to run
1. Open the `tictactoe.py` file.
2. Run it using Python: `python tictactoe.py`
3. Follow the prompts to enter your move.

## Sample Output
Board positions: 0-2 for rows and columns.

Enter row (0-2): 0  
Enter col (0-2): 1  
AI makes its move.  

Continue until either the AI or the player wins, or it is a draw.
